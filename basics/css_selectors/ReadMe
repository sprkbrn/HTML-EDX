Using HTML from: https://codepen.io/w3devcampus/pen/LYNYPEB
Style the following lists using the following instructions

Using the HTML below (in this CodePen), please style the two lists by following these instructions: 

    The female characters are in blue text, and the male characters are red
    Dorothea Brooke and Sydney Carton are bold text
    Joshua Rigg and Madame Defarge are italicized
    The list for Middlemarch is enumerated with roman numerals
    The list for A Tale of Two Cities is enumerated with alpha characters
    The list items for Middlemarch are spaced out more
    The list for Middlemarch has been moved rightward
    Serif font is not used anywhere on the page

Can you achieve the same styling without adding any new tags (i.e., without adding <i> or <b> or <span>) ? Feel free to modify the HTML, but try not to add any new id attributes, if possible.
