                <section id="blurb">This was one of the first dishes I learned to make. It was both simple and rewarding reinforcing my confidence in my ability to cook a good meal.</br></br>I highly suggest you create this dish with boiled asparagus. When made just right, the salmon practically dissolves in your mouth as a profile of sweetness against the bitterness of the asparagus.</br></br></br></br>This is one easy but fun dish to make and can be enjoyed any time of the year. I personally never expected to enjoy the blend of maple and mustard but, somehow they work just right.</section>
